ChipWhispererÂ® Project with TeamOscillo
=====================

TeamOscillo is the study group for side-channel attacks by using ChipWhisperer open project.
Using this forked repository, we want to try to whole codes review. And all the team members
thank for ChipWhisperer. We also want to make easier for whom has no idea of side-channel attacks.

ChipWhisperer is an open source project dedicated to hardware security research. The main
GIT repository is held on the Assembla Page at http://www.chipwhisperer.com , which also
includes link to complete documentation etc.

As a convience, this GitHub repository is setup to periodically clone changes from the main
repository and push them here. Please DO NOT open issues on this repository as it is not
routinely monitored, instead use the Assembla Page. 

But if you prefer the use of GitHub for your own development, feel free to fork this project
from here! You'll be able to view changes in the original ChipWhisperer project.
